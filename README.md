# AjaxApp
This is a small project using Web API 2, CORS and angularjs. It is just a simple demonstration.

I also use SimpleINjector to inject the identity framework components, and move them to a seperate project. 
This will be a baisc example for people who want to move the authorisation logic to a service layer.

This sample also contain Google external login implementation, which is from [Absolute README link](http://bitoftech.net/2014/08/11/asp-net-web-api-2-external-logins-social-logins-facebook-google-angularjs-app/)
